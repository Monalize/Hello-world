# Hello-world
"This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow."
Well to give some more insight about myself. I am a mother of 2, married, been working with Capiktec Bank 11 years. 
Through my curiosity I discovered an interest in data analysis. I enjoy learning, enjoy challenges and always make sure that I get things done.(Currently i'm slacking behind)
